# Examination and Improvements for iOS App Privacy Report

This repository contains the first systematical study of the usability and effectiveness of the iOS App Privacy Report in real-world settings.
Our research follows a clear and logical workflow: 
1) We organized a focus group discussion to explore users' experiences, perceptions,
attitudes, and expectations regarding the App Privacy Report. The findings revealed practical deficiencies of the feature, 
primarily the lack of clarity in data access purposes and domain name descriptions. 
2) Based on user feedback, we developed methods to address these two main concerns. 
3) We conducted experiments to evaluate the performance and usability of our proposed improvements.

In this repository, we provide the key data and code used in our study.
