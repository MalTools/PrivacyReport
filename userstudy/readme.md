# User-Related Study Information

This folder contains all the user-related study materials for this project.

## 1. Participant Information Sheets and Consent Forms

This project includes three user-related studies. Each study has a corresponding **Participant Information Sheet** detailing the study process, and participants sign a **Consent Form**.
For simplicity, we have combined the two documents for each study into one file.

- **Focus Group Discussion**: Conducted to understand everyday users' feelings and opinions about the iOS App Privacy Report. (See `Participant_InfoSheet_Consent_Form_FocusGroup.pdf`)
  
- **Domain Data Collection**: This study collects domain data from usersâ€™ App Privacy Reports to evaluate the performance of our proposed domain identification method using Large Language Models. (See `Participant_InfoSheet_Consent_Form_ReportDataCollection.pdf`)

- **Think Aloud Study**: Designed to assess the usability and utility of our enhanced version of the App Privacy Report. (See `Participant_InfoSheet_Consent_Form_ThinkAloud.pdf`)

*Note: These files are translations of the original signed forms in Simplified Chinese, with anonymized versions.*

## 2. Initial Ethics Review Forms

We submitted two applications to the **Academic Ethics Review Committee** (equivalent to an IRB) for approval:

1. The first application was for the **Focus Group Discussion**, through which we identified limitations of the App Privacy Report in everyday use. (See `Ethics_Review_Form_for_FocusGroup.pdf`)

2. The second application was to evaluate the effectiveness of the domain identification component in our enhancement and assess the usability and utility of the enhanced feature. This includes collecting participants' App Privacy Report records (i.e., **Domain Data Collection**) and the **Think Aloud Study**. (See `Ethics_Review_Form_for_Evaluation.pdf`)

*Note: These forms are translations of the original signed forms in Simplified Chinese, with anonymized versions.*

## 3. Presentation Slides

Slides presented to participants during the **Focus Group Study** and **Think Aloud Study** can also be found in this folder.
